This project is for Plant Seeding Classification challnage in Kaggle.
It uses the Convolutional Neural Network from Machine Learning implemented in Tensorflow for Python.

Project is still under development phase.
In current state, model gives accuracy of 40% on 1 epoch after training of 2 hrs on CPU.
I am trying to train for more time, and will post the accuracy here.
